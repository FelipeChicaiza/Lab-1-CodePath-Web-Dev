# Lab 1: Timetabled Overview
================================

## Project Description
In this project, you will build a grid-style calendar with one-hour events that plan out a single week. The twist? You'll be creating the calendar for someone else - it could be a friend, family member, historical figure, role model, or even an imaginary person. The possibilities are endless! Timetables can be informative, humorous, or exploratory, so feel free to get creative.

## Required Features
To complete this project, your calendar must include the following features:

* A one-week calendar that includes one-hour time blocks
* Events with different titles
* Events with different colors based on their type
